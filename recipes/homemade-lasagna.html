    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Fresh Herbs</strong>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Sugar</strong>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Spices and Seasoning</strong>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Noodles</strong>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cheese</strong>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</p></li>
    </ul>
